## Project Requirements
### Content
I used an illustrated headshot and established branding for my portfolio build.
I have a short blurb in the hero section to grab the viewers attention and introduce myself. I have a longer about me section further down the page. My contact form is working however I had trouble getting the message to align to the left. My portofio site has everything on the home page with child pages for each project. the projects/portfolio section is on the home page. All the links to external sites are working. I ahve linked to my linked In, GitHub, Behance and Instagram.

### Technical
I have developed 2 webpages for my portfolio. A main landning page which has all the elements of my website displayed including my portfolio. The second is a webpage for project 1 HTML/CSS. I attemped to version control but got an error message. This process is still confussing to me so I will go through it with a mentor. My pages are now deployed on GitHub Pages. My website is fully responsive. I designed and developed for mobile first and then used media queried to make them work on larger screen. I am still needing to add media queries and make it resposonsive for a tablet sized screen. 

I am unsure if i used best practice CSS to do this but my final result is what I set out to achieve. I would like some feedback on my CSS please. I did my best to set out my HTML according to best practice. I would like feedback on this too.

### Bonus (optional)
A added styling for hover states for my linkes and buttons. I didn't add any for active states. I will comeback and experiment with that in the future.
I didn't attempt to use Javascript for a hamburger menu as I didn't think i needed it for my website however I would linke to give it a go as I continue to work on my webstite.
