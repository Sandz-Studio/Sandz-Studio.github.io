					<H3 id="project-title"> <span class="emphasis-project">Project 1:</span> Portfolio Website Build</H3>
					<p>We were tasked to create a portfolio site to showcase our work. This portfolio had to represent who we are as aspiring developers whilst also reflecting our own personal style</p>
					<p class="subheading1">Requirements</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Include at least one profile picture.</li>
						<li>Include a biography of you (at least 100 words).</li>
						<li>Include your preferred contact method (for bonus points, use in a contact form that sends an email to you!).</li>
						<li>Have a section dedicated to listing projects you have worked on (there are many projects to add throughout this course!).</li>
						<li>Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.</li>
						<li>Have at least 2 web pages.</li>
						<li>Be version-controlled with Git</li>
						<li>Be deployed on GitHub pages.</li>
						<li>Implement responsive design principles.</li>
						<li>Use semantic HTML and accessible design techniques.</li>
					</ul>
					<br/>
					<p class="subheading1">Bonus</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Have different styles for active, hover and focus states.</li>
						<li>Include a hamburger menu for use on mobile devices using Javascript.</li>
					</ul>
					<br/>
					<p> <span class="emphasis">Challenges:</span> I found working with EM and REM units dificult as I have dyscalculia. I will do work outside of class to better grasp the concept to implement them in my work more.</p>
				
					<p> <span class="emphasis">Improvements:</span> I will attempt to include a hamburger menu in my design. My design works well without it however it would be a good skill to grasp.</p>
